# Discord Webhook Sender

Ye, just a simple web application that sends messages as Discord webhooks.
Don't ask about the logo i just made some random lines and BOOM! logo.

## Running locally
I don't think i need to add this but...

- Clone the repository

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it

- Then install all the dependencies running
```
$ npm install
```

- To run the website just run
```
$ npm run serve
```

Now the website is running locally at http://localhost:3000/ (or in the port specified in `vue.config.js`)
